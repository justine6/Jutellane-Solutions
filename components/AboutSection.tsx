        I’m <strong>Fnu Longla Justine Tekang</strong>, a DevSecOps Engineer and Cloud Architect with over seven years of
        experience designing secure, scalable, and resilient systems across AWS and Azure. My work lives at the
        intersection of automation, observability, and impact—whether I’m building infrastructure for healthcare systems,
        optimizing cloud costs, or enabling multilingual, mission-driven web platforms.

        I’m certified in both <strong>AWS</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong> ecosystems, and I believe DevSecOps isn’t just about pipelines—
        it’s about creating trust in every deployment. Each project I build is guided by that principle, from the technical
        rigor of <em>Jutellane Solutions</em> to the vision-driven purpose of <em>Nouvo Ayiti 2075</em>.

        Beyond engineering, I’m passionate about sustainability and knowledge sharing—empowering communities through
        technology that connects, secures, and inspires. My goal in every environment is the same: <strong>deliver
        automation with integrity, and technology with purpose.</strong>
